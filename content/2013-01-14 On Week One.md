How doth the dev ops intern
  Begin his work at Jive
A history of clouds to learn
  A team on which to thrive

How throughly he reads the docs
  On policy and code
And carefully sets up his box
  With apps he needs to load

To know the team and make new friends
  A lunch for all to eat
A walk, a talk, a flock intends
  For both interns to meet

A nice workspace and good machine
  And snacks to fill one's cheek
An awesome group to join unseen
  It was a good first week
