Today, someone in chat said "That would be a little odd if we all prayed to
Lord British."

<pre>
O Richard, who art in Britannia,
hallowed be thy name.
Thy Avatar come,
Thy will be done
on Earth as it is in Sosaria.
Give us this day our daily mana,
and forgive us our thefts,
as we fail to live up to the Virtues,
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from the Guardian.
Amen.
</pre>
