Title: hostapd and the TL-WDN4800

I have a workstation I use as a home server. It acts as a file server, a web
server, an OpenVPN provider, and a router. When I discovered hostapd, I knew
that I wanted my little server to also provide wireless access.

[hostapd](http://w1.fi/wpa_supplicant/) is a piece of software that allows a
linux box with a supported wireless card to act as an access point instead of
a client: other wireless devices, such as laptops and smart phones, can connect
to it just as they would connect to a wireless router.

Hardware
========

After doing some research, the wireless network card I chose was the
[TP-LINK TL-WDN4800](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007GMPZ0A/). It was
reasonably priced, supported both 2.4GHz and 5GHz, and had native linux
support using the ATH9k drivers.

Installation
============

Setting up the software was pretty easy. On Debian, all it took was:

```shell
sudo aptitude install wireless-tools iw hostapd crda
```

The default configuration file works reasonably well, and is useful for
ensuring that the other elements of an access point / router set up are working
before introducing security complications. After I made sure that my clients
could associate without a password, obtain a DHCP lease, and get out to the
internet, I then changed the configuration to require a passphrase.

Software
========

There are a few tools I found to be helpful. The first lists all the SSIDs in
range: `/sbin/iwlist scan`. This will show you the name of each access point
your card can see, as well as channel, frequency, and bitrates:

```shell
$ /sbin/iwlist scan
wlan0     Scan completed :
          Cell 01 - Address: 00:00:AB:CD:EF:00
                    Channel:1
                    Frequency:2.412 GHz (Channel 1)
                    Quality=63/70  Signal level=-47 dBm
                    Encryption key:on
                    ESSID:"Example"
                    Bit Rates:6 Mb/s; 9 Mb/s; 12 Mb/s; 18 Mb/s; 24 Mb/s
                              36 Mb/s; 48 Mb/s; 54 Mb/s
                    Mode:Master
                    Extra:tsf=00000002919ecdc3
                    Extra: Last beacon: 2160ms ago
                    IE: IEEE 802.11i/WPA2 Version 1
                        Group Cipher : CCMP
                        Pairwise Ciphers (1) : CCMP
                        Authentication Suites (1) : PSK
```

In this case, the access point is named "Example", has a password configured,
and is running in the 2.4GHz spectrum.

The other tool I found to be useful is `/sbin/iw list`. This will give you all
the details about your wireless interfaces. Here is the output for the
TL-WDN4800:

Troubleshooting
===============

I did run into a problem trying to use the 5GHz channels. `iw list` showed me
that the card did support 5GHz, as did the box the card came in, but every
time I tried to configure hostapd to use one of the 5GHz channels I got the
error:

```
hostapd: wlan0: IEEE 802.11 Configured channel (36) not found from the channel list of current mode (2) IEEE 802.11a
rmdir[ctrl_interface]: No such file or directory
hostapdrmdir[ctrl_interface]: No such file or directory
```

The solution to this problem turned out to be to install the Central
Regulatory Domain Agent and restart. I have added the crda package to the
install line above.

The other problem I ran into was:

```
HT (IEEE 802.11n) with WPA/WPA2 requires CCMP to be enabled, disabling HT capabilities
```

In order to resolve this, I uncommented the line

```
wpa_pairwise=TKIP CCMP
```

Surprise
========

One thing I didn't realize, but which makes perfect sense in retrospect, is
that I can't provide both 2.4GHz and 5GHz service with the single card. While
the card can operate on either band, it has only a single radio, and so can
only operate on one at a time. If you want to provide both using hostapd, you
will need a second wireless card to provide the other band.

Conclusion
==========

I'm very happy with my setup. I have one fewer thing to plug in, one fewer
opaque piece of hardware to maintain, and one more service on my home server.
