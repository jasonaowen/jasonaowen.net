A year ago, I was learning about unit tests. I was also taking a compilers
course.

When I sat down to work on the first homework, I wasn't really in the mood.
Instead, I messed around with writing a test suite. When I couldn't think of
any other tests to write, I thought to myself, "Alright, enough messing
around."

I started working on the assignment proper. And I discovered the beauty of
test-driven development.

The suite of tests I had written were indispensable. They gave me immediate
feedback on the code I had just written. They gave me a progress bar that
ticked up steadily as I worked through the assignment. And when I was done,
I knew I was done because all my tests passed.

I started every homework assignment in that class by writing tests.
