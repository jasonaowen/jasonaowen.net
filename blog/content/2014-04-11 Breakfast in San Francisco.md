I walked south along the
[Embarcadero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarcadero_(San_Francisco)). For
no obvious reason, there was a giant bow and arrow in the ground, with a
plaque naming it "Cupid's Span".

I kept walking along the waterfront until I got to [Town's End Bakery &
Restaurant](http://www.townsendrb.com).  I found a place to sit and the waiter
took my order, and then something magical happened: they brought me
mini muffins!

They were delicious. One of them tasted a bit of cinnamon, one had raisins,
and two had chocolate chips.

Breakfast proper was the French toast sampler, which had a slice each of egg
bread, whole wheat, and raisin walnut bread. Everything was delicious.

For dessert, I had the mini muffin with more chocolate chips I set aside
earlier.

All in all, it was a great way to start my weekend in San Francisco.
