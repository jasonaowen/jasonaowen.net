After breakfast, I walked back north. I stopped to read about the history of
the waterfront and the piers and the rise of the [dockworkers
union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Longshore_and_Warehouse_Union).

After that, I paid a visit to the [San Francisco Railway
Museum](http://www.streetcar.org). It was smaller than I expected from the
name "Museum", but it was free, and the attendant really knew his stuff. I
read about the history of the streetcar in San Francisco, heard about the
private companies competing to provide service, operated the salvaged and
refurbished remains of a streetcar that was once in service, and saw a 1:8
scale model of a streetcar.

I also really appreciated the t-shirt that read "[Information Gladly Given, But
Safety Requires Avoiding Unnecessary
Conversation](http://laughingsquid.com/polite-but-antisocial-sf-muni-information-gladly-given-shirt/)."

Then I wandered across the street to explore the market and look at all the
hand-made goods, and sat and people-watched in the park for a bit. It's a bit
overcast, but the sun has been peeking out from time to time, and a group of
people are playing with bubbles, which delighted the couple at the table next
to mine.

Sitting in the sun next to the park, with the ferry building clock chiming the
half hour, has been a fantastic setting for writing.
